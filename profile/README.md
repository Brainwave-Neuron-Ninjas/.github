# Brainwave Neuron Ninjas

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of the Brainwave Neuron Ninjas team! We are a group of students and machine learning enthusiasts who are passionate about using AI to solve real-world problems.

## Project Name

MRI and Alzheimers (Magnetic Resonance Imaging Comparisons of Demented and Non demented Adults)

## Project Description

Our current project involves developing a machine learning model that can predict Alzheimer's disease based on MRI scans of the brain. 
We are using the OASIS dataset, which contains MRI scans from both healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer's disease. 
Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease in its early stages, when treatment is most effective.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains all the code, documentation, and other resources related to our Alzheimer's disease prediction project. Here's a brief overview of the repository structure:

- data: This directory contains the OASIS dataset and any other data files that we use in our project.
notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that we use for exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- src: This directory contains the source code for our machine learning models and any other scripts that we use in our project.
- docs: This directory contains project documentation, including a detailed project plan, progress reports, and any other relevant information.
- LICENSE: This file contains the license under which our project is released.
